# TimeClock

TimeClock is a simple ruby based time tracking script that stores punches and notes in a CSV file. The ruby script serves as a core component of a Alfred Workflow for time tracking. Users can trigger TimeClock using "tc" as an alfred keyword. After the keyword a punch action ("in" or "out") should be provided. An optional note
can be included as well.
